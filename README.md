# DAILYJOURNAL

This is a project i created to learn Laravel and it's been a seriously satisfying and fun process so i decided to share it in hopes of getting feedback on my code as well as learning from other people and see how they'd approach certain problems during development

## MOTIVATION

The basic idea of this project was to create a way to document your daily activities and what's been remarkable about your day in hopes of helping you keep track of perhaps good habits that made them happy that day or keep track of their social life

## FEATURES OF THE APP

1. Easy and intruitive UI
2. Accessible and very minimal
3. Respnsive design for mobile users using tailwindCSS
4. Ability to "rate" your day by using a slider element
5. Thw background of the published journal changes based on the rating you gave

## THE TECH STACK USED

For this project i wanted to learn more about Laravel development so i decided to try the **TALL** stack which is considered more "modern" than traditional MVC architecture and it consists of :

1. **T**ailwindCSS for the styling - loved it so much since it enabled me to have more control over my styling without the hastle of keeping up with CSS identifiers for my elements and such

2. **A**lpine.JS - super minimal javascript frontend framework that looks like Jquery at first glance and honestly it comes hand to hand with Livewire so i will give my opinion about them down below

3. **L**ivewire - a really powerful way to scaffold dynamic UI for your laravel projects with resemblance to JS frameworks like Vue and React since it's component - based

4. **L**aravel - a truly powerful and enjoyable PHP framework that comes with endless features and packages out of the box ranking it the top framework when it comes to the developer experience and it powers this project i made

For storage i simply used sqlite since it's configured by default and i used laravel breeze for auth tasks (login,register,forgot password,confirm email, etc)

## WHAT I'VE LEARNED BUILDING THIS PROJECT

I learnd how to use Livewire and build components with it rather than the traditional Laravel MVC way which was quite a fun experience but not for me tbh

## WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THIS PROJECT

I didn't like Livewire/Volt tbh because of the concept of components that resembles React and Vue ( my personal opinion only ) as opposed to the MBC way which i honestly enjoyed way more since i had control of everything and i had great advantage with an amazing feature named route binding

So overall Livewire was ight but i won't use it in future projects
